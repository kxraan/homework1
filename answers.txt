What is a remote repository?


Rebase "reapplies commits on top of another base branch”, whereas merge "joins two or more development histories together”. 
In other words, the key difference between merge and rebase is that while merge preserves history as it happened, rebase rewrites it.

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
